# Crypto Landing Page (Spite Project)

This was a fun project built with Next.js 14, Chakra UI, Framer Motion, emotion and Animate.css. I thoroughly enjoyed 
exploring new frameworks, expanding my skills and knowledge in the process. This project allowed me to learn about 
several UI compatibility concepts that are built in Next.js, I was also allowed to work with Vercel and deploy my application 
with amazing build and deploy option configured with GitHub.
